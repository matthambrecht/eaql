# Language Architecture

## Preface
A major reason I started this project was because I wanted to explore how to make a computer language. By creating a query language I was able to expand this project into not only learning how to make a computer language, but also into making an associated database which is another project I wanted to explore at some point in my life.

## Documentation
In this documentation we will explore how I went about coming up with a lot of how the language works. The processing of our language itself boils down to 3 different parts. It is suggested that you go through these in order to get a full understanding:
1. [Scanning](./SCANNING.md)
2. [Parsing](./PARSING.md)
3. [Transpiling](./TRANSPILING.md)
